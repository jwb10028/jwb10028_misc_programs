`# Miscellaneous C++ Coding Problems and Programs  This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous C++ coding problems and programs, showcasing various aspects of the C++ programming language. These examples range from basic syntax demonstrations to more complex problem-solving scenarios.  ## Getting Started  To run these programs, you'll need a C++ compiler like GCC or Clang. Most of these examples can be compiled using the following command:  ```bash g++ -std=c++17 your_program.cpp -o your_program`

Replace `your_program.cpp` with the name of the file you wish to compile.
